Welcome to a stripped down version of Instagram! It has all the main features such as creating a post, deleting it, uploading a profile image, liking/unliking a post and more. This is more of a redesign than anything else. But enjoy and play around with it!

This project is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework. It also uses Passport/Passport Local for user authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, along with express sessions and flash to flash error messages for incorrect logins. All of the users data will be stored in a MongoDB database. First the user will need to sign up entering their username, email, password and confirm their password as well. Once they sign up, they will be automatically logged in where they will be redirected to the feed page where they will see all the posts available. The user can like/unlike a post, visit the post page to view it more closely and add comments. The user can view their profile as well as others and delete their own posts and comments if they choose. All images are hosted on Cloudinary.

## If you want to try this project out with dummy accounts:

Emails: terra@example.com, bob@example.com, yoda@email.com
<br>
Passwords: terra1234, bob12345, yoda1234

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would love to implement a follow system so the user can follow others. I would also love to create a settings page so the user would be able to change their password as well as delete their account if they choose.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use Bootstrap for styling as well as use method override for making PUT and DELETE request using forms. I also learned how to use Cloudinary for image hosting as well as handling image uploading.
