Welcome to a stripped down version of Instagram! It has all the main features such as creating a post, deleting it, uploading a profile image, liking/unliking a post and more. This is more of a redesign than anything else. But enjoy and play around with it!

## If you want to try this project out with dummy accounts:

Emails: terra@example.com, bob@example.com, yoda@email.com
<br>
Passwords: terra1234, bob12345, yoda1234

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would love to implement a follow system so the user can follow others. I would also love to create a settings page so the user would be able to change their password as well as delete their account if they choose.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use Bootstrap for styling as well as use method override for making PUT and DELETE request using forms. I also learned how to use Cloudinary for image hosting as well as handling image uploading.
